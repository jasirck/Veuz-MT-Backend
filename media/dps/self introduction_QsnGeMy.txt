Good morning! I'm Muhammed Jasir CK, and I'm from Calicut in Kerala. I'm a self-taught Full Stack Developer specializing in Django for the backend and React for the frontend. I also have a solid understanding of both SQL and NoSQL databases.

One of my greatest strengths is my ability to learn on my own and adapt to new environments quickly. After completing my higher secondary education, I joined a self-learning bootcamp. Within just seven months, without any mentors or teachers—just using resources available online—I was able to become a Full Stack Developer. I'm also highly interested in learning new technologies and continuously expanding my skill set to stay up-to-date in this fast-evolving field.

I believe my adaptability and determination to learn make me a great fit for any team. I can easily adjust to different work environments and tackle new challenges. On the flip side, one area where I struggled in the past was managing my time efficiently, especially when it came to distractions like social media. To address this, I started using an app that restricts social media usage during work hours, which has significantly improved my productivity.

I'm excited about the opportunity to bring my skills, passion for learning, and self-driven mindset to your organization, and I look forward to contributing to your team's success.
